        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>We offer refunds only in cases where the work is objectively incorrect after part of the project has been completed. If the project is partially completed and the work is deemed unsatisfactory or incorrect, a partial refund may be issued.</p>
        <p>If you are not satisfied with the final result of your project, we will work with you to resolve any issues. However, a refund will not be issued unless there is an objective error in the completed work.</p>
