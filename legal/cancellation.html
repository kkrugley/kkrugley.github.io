        <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p>Once work on a project has begun, prepayment is non-refundable. If you decide to cancel the project after it has been started, no refund will be issued for the amount paid. However, if the project is canceled before work begins, a full refund can be provided.</p>
        <p>If you need to cancel or pause the project, please contact us as soon as possible, and we will work to find a solution based on the stage of work and mutual agreement.</p>
