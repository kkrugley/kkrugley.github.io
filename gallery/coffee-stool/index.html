  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>&emsp;The first step in developing the project was to define key functions and create rough sketches. During my research, I identified several possible functions for the object:</p>
  <ul>
    <ol>a storage space;</ol>  
    <ol>a retractable backrest for the stool;</ol>
    <ol>a surface that can serve as a table or a stand for hot drinks.</ol>
  </ul>
  <p>&emsp;As an avid coffee lover and fan of cozy summer terraces, I chose the concept of a stool that would fit perfectly into such settings. My idea was to create a multifunctional item that would serve both as a stool and a versatile stand for drinks and other small items.</p>

  <p>&emsp;In working on the project, I created many sketches, exploring different design and functional solutions. One of the initial ideas was a folding stand, but after several experiments, I decided to move away from this idea in favor of a static and solid design, which would provide reliability and durability.</p>
  <img class="content-image" src="img/production.jpg">
  <p>&emsp;I made a series of sketches and developed 3D models to better understand the spatial arrangement and visual perception. On this page, you can view the 3D model of the stool and see how it looks in real life using augmented reality (AR) technology.</p>
  <p>&emsp;After creating the 3D model and finalizing the design, I moved on to prototyping. For this, I used cardboard that I found in a city dumpster. To achieve the necessary thickness of the parts, I cut several layers of cardboard and glued them together. Once I was satisfied with the prototype design, I purchased high-quality plywood and made the stool myself using a CNC milling machine, a miter saw, a drill press, and other woodworking tools.</p>
  <p>&emsp;The project was successfully completed and presented at the design department of UAP University in Poznań, where it received high praise. I plan to further improve the current model, remake it from plywood, and also add versions made from acrylic and wood. Additionally, I plan to conduct a professional photoshoot for further product presentation.</p>
